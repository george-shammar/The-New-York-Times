#Project Title:

 The Title of the project is the New York Times.



#About The Project and Purpose of the Project:

 The project was designed as a repilca of the New York Times online Newspaper page of March 17th, 2014. 
 The purpose is to capture as much as possible every segment of the page to look exactly like the original.
 A repository was created with two branhes (master- New York Times and branch- cloned project). 
 The idea was to develop the project in it's entirety within the branch while adopting paired programming practice all through.
 
 The two project contributors are George Gbenle and Abdelrahman Mahmoud. 
 Both contributors acted as driver and navigator intermittently.




#Technologies Used:
 The project was aimed to be built entirely with HTML and CSS. Attempts were made to create every component of the page using HTML and CSS as long as it's creeable.
 Other components of the page requiring strictly other technologies outside of HTML and CSS were left out as beyond the scope of the project.


#Key Markup Elements:
 The HTML contaians the regular sematic tags:
 <header>
 <footer>
 <section>
 <aside> was used for the upper "editor's pick" column as well as the "Most Popular" segment.
 Material icons were referenced in the code.




#Styling
 -Flexbox was used to arrange the following sections of the page:
    1. The top navigation bar with the New York Times logo, the "Search" and "Menu" bars with the "Subscribe Now" and "Login Buttons".
    2.The social media icons.
    3.The footer elements.





-Grid: was used to style the following elements:
 1. The images at the theory of inflation section.
 2. The first set of six images at the foot of the page with "More in Space Astronomy" heading.
 3. The second set of three images namely "Editor's pick".
 4. Absolute and relative positioning were used imterchangeably.
