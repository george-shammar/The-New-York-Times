# The New York Times
 First project for The New York Times clone.

The objective of the project is clone The New York Times Page.
HTML and CSS was used as the only language to structure and style the project.
All the media files included were imported from the original copy of the New York Times Page.
Some styling conventions were also adopted from the original while others were invented.
The flexbox, grid and element positioning using "float and position" properties were used to implement some of the stylings.
